| [Monster Rifle](item/monster_rifle.md)  | This is a gun that rapidly shoots filled capture balls!                            |
| [Dog Gun](item/guns/dog_gun.md)         | It's a dog that's a gun which farts out other dogs (which are not guns) (credit to Vaeux on reddit for the idea)                                                                                                  |
| [Ban Missile](item/guns/ban_missile.md) | A fairly balanced weapon to fight Lv10 worlds' harsh hostiles, light enough for a glitch to wield alongside a shield (thanks to crudebuster on the forums)                                                       |
