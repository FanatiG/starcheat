**Latest version:** 0.16 (Enraged Koala) [2014-06-01]

These are builds of the latest development version. They should work fine, but may be unstable. **Don't forget to back up your save files before using them.**

**NOTE:** starcheat is not a normal mod, it's a separate program. You don't need to put it in the Starbound mods folder.

====== Windows ======

[[http://callan.io/builds/starcheat-0.16.zip|Download here]]

**NOTE:** If Windows complains about a system error (re: missing msvcr100.dll), you probably need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package.

===== How to run =====
  - Download the starcheat .zip file above
  - Extract all files into a folder somewhere (not the mods folder)
  - Go into the newly created folder
  - Run **starcheat.exe**
  - Follow the prompts to configure starcheat (only happens once)
  - Open a player
