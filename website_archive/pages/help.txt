This is stuff you can do when starcheat stops working. [[#reset_all_settings|Clearing local settings]] and checking you did the setup correctly is always a good first step.

**If you've tried all this stuff but starcheat is still broken, please post a bug report in the [[http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/starcheat-player-save-editor-and-python-library.60174/|discussion thread]] for support.**

====== Known issues ======
  * If you get a **System Error dialog** as soon as you run starcheat, you probably need [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=14632|this Windows update]].
  * If you get a message like **no compatible saves** found it means the player folder was not detected properly or you haven't created and players in Starbound yet. To update the player folder location:
    - Open up the options dialog in starcheat (Tools menu > Options)
    - Set the Starbound Folder option to the correct folder
    - Click Save
    - Try open a new player (File menu > Open)
  *  If **missing inventory icons** are being displayed, you see **no species** to select or you **can't edit items**; the assets folder location may not have been detected properly:
    - Open up the options dialog in starcheat (Tools menu > Options)
    - Set the Starbound Folder option to the correct one
    - Click Rebuild DB
    - Click Save
    - Restart starcheat

====== Reporting a new error ======
Any other errors or if starcheat doesn't start you can do these steps:
  - Follow these instructions and then try run starcheat again
  - If that doesn't work, please make a new post in [[http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/starcheat-player-save-editor-and-python-library.60174/|this thread]] with the following information:
    * A copy of the latest starcheat logs (instructions to get logs are [[#how_to_get_logs|here]])
    * A list of any mods installed
    * //(Optional)// A screenshot of the error
    * //(Optional)// A .zip file containing any .player files you're having trouble with
