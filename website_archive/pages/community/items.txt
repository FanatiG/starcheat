^ Name ^ Description ^
| [[community:item:monster_rifle|Monster Rifle]] | This is a gun that rapidly shoots filled capture balls! |
| [[community:item:guns:dog_gun|Dog Gun]] | It's a dog that's a gun which farts out other dogs (which are not guns) (credit to Vaeux on reddit for the idea) |
| [[community:item:guns:ban_missile|Ban Missile]] | A fairly balanced weapon to fight Lv10 worlds' harsh hostiles, light enough for a glitch to wield alongside a shield (thanks to crudebuster on the forums) |
