starcheat item files are just JSON text files, very similar to Starbound assets before they're packed. They can be exported, imported again and edited with a text editor like Notepad.

Example items can be found in the [[community:items|community items]] section.

  - Double click an empty inventory slot
  - Click cancel on the item browser dialog
  - Click the import item button in the bottom left of the item edit dialog
  - Select and open a saved item file
  - //(Optional)// Make changes to the item from the edit dialog
  - Click Ok

====== Import an item ======
  - Double click a filled inventory slot to open the edit dialog
  - Click the import item button in the bottom left of the dialog
