**Latest version:** 0.17 (Enraged Koala) [2014-06-01]

These are builds of the latest development version. They should work fine, but may be unstable. **Don't forget to back up your save files before using them.**

**NOTE:** starcheat is not a normal mod, it's a separate program. You don't need to put it in the Starbound mods folder.

# Windows

[Download here](https://github.com/wizzomafizzo/starcheat/releases)

**NOTE:** If Windows complains about a system error (re: missing msvcr100.dll), you probably need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package.

## How to run

 1.  Download the starcheat .zip file above
 2.  Extract all files into a folder somewhere (not the mods folder)
 3.  Go into the newly created folder
 4.  Run **starcheat.exe**
 5.  Follow the prompts to configure starcheat (only happens once)
 6.  Open a player
