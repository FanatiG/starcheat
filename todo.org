** [0/10] Improvements
*** TODO Unique item generation
*** TODO Manage techs
*** TODO Manage blueprints
*** TODO Manage appearance
*** TODO Manage pets
Is this possible? I don't see it in the .player file.
*** TODO Improve variant edit ui
This should be a tree model view. I think before this happens there needs to be
a way to convert between the save file variants to json/plain python types
*** TODO Unit tests
*** TODO Use starbound top level folder
Will make it easier to do auto detection and less things for users to configure
*** TODO Application icon
This needs to be:
- 96x96 for the mod db
- 32x32 and 64x64 for regular icons (and maybe 16?)
- vector image
  maybe... i can't really remember how mac icons work. is it svg?
*** [0/2] Better crash dialog
I'm not sure this is possible anymore. Qt dialogs must have a parent and I can't
work out a way to pass this to the exception hook.
**** TODO Crash dialog UI
Should have:
- Save log button
- Text edit box containing traceback (so you can copy paste)
- Continue/restart buttons?
**** TODO Add to sys exception hook
*** TODO Remove config and logging modules from assets.py
I want this to be a relatively portable assets library
