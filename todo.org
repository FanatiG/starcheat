** [3/17] Improvements
*** TODO Manage appearance
**** TODO Create basic dialog to edit values directly
**** TODO New system for rendering players
*** TODO Options dialog
**** TODO Auto rebuild db if folder was changed
**** TODO Rebuild DB feedback
A progress indicator would be nice but it requires splitting up init_db and
reimplementing it in gui_utils. This would be nice for the initial setup too.
**** TODO Validate options
**** TODO Clear logs, show logs size
**** TODO Move tools menu options to dialog
***** TODO Implement save backups
This would basically save a revision of the save file every time it is updated.
Perhaps later there could also be a dialog to rollback changes.
***** TODO Update timestamps
Don't bother until the next patch. Location of it may change.
*** TODO Unique item generation
Depends on having a way to convert from asset to item.
*** TODO Improve variant edit ui
This should be a tree model view. I think before this happens there needs to be
a way to convert between the save file variants to json/plain python types
*** TODO Inventory management
Maybe like inventory sorting? Store in ship?
*** TODO Manage players
Stick a delete button on the open player dialog. Make it move the player file (and metadata)
to the backup dir
**** TODO Backup revision rollback
*** TODO Application icon
This needs to be:
- 96x96 for the mod db
- 32x32 and 64x64 for regular icons (and maybe 16?)
- vector image
  maybe... i can't really remember how mac icons work. is it svg?
*** TODO Update windows standalone build
Change the folder name from dist to starcheat and I think there is an option in
cx_freeze to pack all the libraries. Hide the terminal window
LICENSE.txt should be copied in as well
*** TODO Use modinfo file when loading mod assets
After patch.
*** TODO Remove config and logging modules from assets.py
I want this to be a relatively portable assets library
*** TODO Unit tests
*** TODO Manage techs
this one is a bit complicated and pretty minor considering you can spawn chips
*** TODO Manage pets
Pets are just inventory items atm. No need.
*** TODO Better crash dialog
**** TODO Crash dialog UI
Should have:
- Save log button
- Text edit box containing traceback (so you can copy paste)
- Continue/restart buttons?
- More info in the traceback (config stuff, platform)
**** DONE Add to sys exception hook
*** DONE About dialog
Just a simple one w/ icon, app name, license and link to github/mod db
*** DONE Access item browser in tools menu
*** DONE Use starbound top level folder
Will make it easier to do auto detection and less things for users to configure
- Update config
- Update options dialog
- Change first setup so it just shows a file open dialog
** [3/7] Bugs
*** TODO can't drag between item tables
Need to replace the current widget with table views.
*** TODO Moving items does not trigger modified state
*** TODO some items are missing
**** iron lantern
**** some tier crafted weapons
*** TODO GUI issues
**** [0/4] Mac
***** TODO appearance and blueprint buttons are cut off
***** TODO item tables in tab box are out of alignment/wrong length
***** TODO description box only one line
***** TODO spinbox arrows cut off
**** [0/1] Windows
***** TODO item tables cut off/aligningment
*** DONE a 0 items database is obviously broken. add a check for this
*** DONE missing support for modded races
*** DONE troubleshooting section is still not friendly enough
Hopefuly that's enough.
