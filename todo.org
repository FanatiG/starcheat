** [10/20] Improvements
*** DONE Manage appearance
**** TODO Create basic dialog to edit values directly
**** TODO New system for rendering players
*** DONE Options dialog
**** TODO Auto rebuild db if folder was changed
**** TODO Rebuild DB feedback
A progress indicator would be nice but it requires splitting up init_db and
reimplementing it in gui_utils. This would be nice for the initial setup too.
**** TODO Validate options
**** TODO Clear logs, show logs size
**** TODO Move tools menu options to dialog
***** TODO Implement save backups
This would basically save a revision of the save file every time it is updated.
Perhaps later there could also be a dialog to rollback changes.
***** TODO Update timestamps
Don't bother until the next patch. Location of it may change.
*** DONE Unique item generation
Depends on having a way to convert from asset to item.
*** DONE Backups management
*** DONE [#B] Add checks dur0ing indexing and prompt to reselect folder
init_db will need to be redone in gui_utils. this will also let us
do feedback during a rebuild
*** TODO Improve variant edit ui
This should be a tree model view. I think before this happens there needs to be
a way to convert between the save file variants to json/plain python types
*** TODO Inventory management
Maybe like inventory sorting? Store in ship?
*** DONE Manage players
Stick a delete button on the open player dialog. Make it move the player file (and metadata)
to the backup dir
**** TODO Backup revision rollback
*** TODO Build number in about dialog and logs
*** TODO Add more details to crash dialog log
build version
config
os
*** TODO Application icon
This needs to be:
- 96x96 for the mod db
- 32x32 and 64x64 for regular icons (and maybe 16?)
- vector image
  maybe... i can't really remember how mac icons work. is it svg?
*** TODO Update windows standalone build
Change the folder name from dist to starcheat and I think there is an option in
cx_freeze to pack all the libraries. Hide the terminal window
LICENSE.txt should be copied in as well
*** TODO Remove config and logging modules from assets.py
I want this to be a relatively portable assets library
*** TODO Manage techs
this one is a bit complicated and pretty minor considering you can spawn chips
*** TODO Manage pets
Pets are just inventory items atm. No need.
*** TODO Better crash dialog
**** TODO Crash dialog UI
Should have:
- Save log button
- Text edit box containing traceback (so you can copy paste)
- Continue/restart buttons?
- More info in the traceback (config stuff, platform)
**** DONE Add to sys exception hook
*** DONE Use modinfo file when loading mod assets
After patch.
*** DONE About dialog
Just a simple one w/ icon, app name, license and link to github/mod db
*** DONE Access item browser in tools menu
*** DONE Use starbound top level folder
Will make it easier to do auto detection and less things for users to configure
- Update config
- Update options dialog
- Change first setup so it just shows a file open dialog
** [3/9] Bugs
*** TODO can't drag between item tables
Need to replace the current widget with table views.
*** TODO issues importing itemnames
not sure what the items are but apparently they're valid json. mods?
might just add a skip if itemname can't be found anywhere
*** TODO Moving items does not trigger modified state
*** TODO duplicate assets imported if they overwrite default ones
*** TODO some items are missing
**** iron lantern
**** some tier crafted weapons
*** TODO GUI issues
**** [0/4] Mac
***** TODO appearance and blueprint buttons are cut off
***** TODO item tables in tab box are out of alignment/wrong length
***** TODO description box only one line
***** TODO spinbox arrows cut off
**** [0/2] Windows
***** TODO item tables cut off/aligningment
***** TODO issue on win 8 fonts too large
possibly system wide font setting?
check if it's an issue in dialogs
how hard would it be to make the main window resizable? i think the inventory tables
are the biggest hurdle
*** DONE a 0 items database is obviously broken. add a check for this
*** DONE missing support for modded races
*** DONE troubleshooting section is still not friendly enough
Hopefuly that's enough.
